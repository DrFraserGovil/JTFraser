-Hi, Iâ€™m @JTFraser

I am a theoretical astrophysicist, working primarily on the chemical evolution of galaxies,
thogh my interests also veer into the dynamical side of things from time to time.

I primarily study these topics through the construction of high-performance, highly-parallelised
C++ simulations, which is what you will mainly find on my GitHub profile.
